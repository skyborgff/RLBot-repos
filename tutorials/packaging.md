# packaging tutorial

after creating the botit can be packaged. this can be done by writing packaging.json to the main folder of your bot, [readme.md](https://github.com/ard1998/RLBot-repos/blob/master/README.md) contains the syntax and an example for botpackage.json. currently we do only support github as package host.

the maintainer needs to know the name of the botfolder (what will be used as botname), the github repo link and the branch name.
